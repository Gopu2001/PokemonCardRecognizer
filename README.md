# PokemonCardRecognizer
Recognize scanned Pok√©mon Cards super fast. I will be using a trained model. Keep in mind that the model will be trained on approximately 10,500 distinct images (only one per class)!

# Stay Tuned!
This repository is still being developed and a Django application will serve the frontend for the project.

# Alert on the Backend websites used to scrape data from
As shown in the files inside the repository, I have scraped some results into a SQLite database. Keep in mind that problems have been found with the backend source where I have scraped and this SQLite table is not the correct and updated version.
